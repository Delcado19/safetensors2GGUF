# Known Conversion Errors and Fixes

Analysis of GitHub Issues from [city96/ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF/issues).

---

## 1. `inf`/`NaN` values after conversion

**Error message:**
```
ggml_validate_row_data: found inf value at block 0
llama_model_quantize: failed to quantize: tensor 'norm_final.weight' has invalid data
```

**Cause:** BF16 values in the source model exceed the representable F16 range (> 65504)
after conversion. `llama-quantize` refuses to quantize the file.

**Fix:**
```python
# In handle_tensors(), before dtype conversion:
data = torch.nan_to_num(data, nan=0.0, posinf=65504, neginf=-65504)
```

## 2. `size mismatch` when loading — BF16 1D tensors

**Error message:**
```
size mismatch for x_pad_token: copying a param with shape torch.Size([3840])
from checkpoint, the shape in current model is torch.Size([1, 3840])
```

**Cause:** BF16-encoded 1D tensors are interpreted as twice as many bytes when read
from GGUF (BF16 = 2 bytes, but read as uint8 → appears twice as long).

**Affected keys:** `x_pad_token`, `cap_pad_token`, `.scale` norm weights.

**Fix:** Add these keys to `keys_hiprec` of the architecture class → stored as F32,
immune to this problem.

## 3. Wrong architecture detection

**Error message:**
```
AssertionError: Unknown model architecture!
# or:
AssertionError: Model architecture not allowed for conversion!
```

**Causes:**
- Model is in **reference format** instead of Diffusers format (has `keys_banned` keys)
- Model is a **merge** whose keys deviate slightly from the standard
- External GGUF file without `general.architecture` field, key matching fails

**Diagnosis:** Check `keys_detect` of the relevant architecture class to see whether
the detection keys are present in the state dict.

## 4. `mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied` — matrix multiplication error

**Error message:**
```
RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (NxM and KxM)
```

**Cause A — `shape_fix` reshape without metadata restoration:**
For SD1/SDXL, tensors are reshaped to `(n//256, 256)`. The original shape is stored
as a `comfy.gguf.orig_shape.<key>` metadata field. If this field is missing when
loading, the tensor remains in the wrong shape → matmul fails.

**Cause B — incorrect `shape_fix` usage:**
`shape_fix=True` must only be set for SD1/SDXL. For other architectures
(Flux, SD3, etc.) it produces incompatible tensor shapes.

**Fix:** Enable `shape_fix` only in `ModelSD1` and `ModelSDXL`. Always write
`orig_shape` metadata alongside the reshape.

## 5. `GGML_ASSERT(ne[i] > 0)` in llama-quantize

**Error message:**
```
/ggml/src/ggml.c:22112: GGML_ASSERT(info->ne[i] > 0) failed
```

**Cause:** The GGUF file produced by `convert.py` contains tensors with a dimension
of 0, or the shape metadata is invalid for llama.cpp's validator.
Common with merge models that have unusual tensor shapes.

**Note:** The F16 GGUF is created successfully — the error only appears during the
second step (`llama-quantize`).

## 6. `gather(): Expected dtype int64 for index`

**Error message:**
```
gather(): Expected dtype int64 for index
```

**Cause:** An index tensor is created with `torch.int32` in the dequantization logic.
PyTorch ≥ 2.6 requires `int64` for `torch.gather`.

**Fix:**
```python
# dequant.py ~line 280:
# before:
qs = torch.gather(kvalues, dim=-1, index=qs.to(torch.int32))
# after:
qs = torch.gather(kvalues, dim=-1, index=qs.to(torch.int64))
```

---

## 7. `only 0-dimensional arrays can be converted to Python scalars`

**Cause:** The `gguf` library sometimes returns 1D arrays of size 1 instead of true
0D scalars for scalar metadata fields. `.item()` then fails.

**Fix:** When reading metadata fields, check whether the array has size 1 before
calling `.item()`.
